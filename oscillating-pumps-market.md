<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oscillating Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Leaf"</li><li>"Coil"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oscillating pumps market is primarily categorized into two types: "Leaf" and "Coil" pumps. Leaf pumps utilize a flexible membrane that moves in a leaf-like motion to create a pumping action, suitable for low-flow applications with gentle handling of fluids. In contrast, coil pumps employ a coiled structure that oscillates to generate higher pressure and flow rates, making them ideal for demanding industrial uses. Both types serve varied applications based on efficiency, capacity, and fluid characteristics.</p></p>
